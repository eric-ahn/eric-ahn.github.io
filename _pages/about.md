Hey everyone! I'm Eric Ahn.

I'm from Georgia, studied Operations Research and Financial as an undergraduate and received my Masters in Finance at Princeton. I'm now working in Chicago! 

I hope to use this blog to share some of my interests and the things I've been working on currently. Take a look at my bookshelf to see what I've been reading recently!
